# Sveltekit Website
### Background
I was recommended to use Sveltekit when I asked a friend which javascript framework to use. So far, I am not disappointed. 

My previous experience in web design is with Python's Flask framework and sqlite. It worked well, but was a bit cumbersome and did not update the preview without refreshing the website. 

So far, I like Sveltekit more. It updates as I write files in neovim, which is great for me since I'm not too familiar with what all the CSS options do.

### Purpose
I want to create a website that is akin to those carrd.co websites I've been seeing. 

It would be a nice little about me page with a bit of information and links to my stuff (like Github). I've always liked the idea of building a nice looking website, so I figure I should do it.

# Getting started with svelte
Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
